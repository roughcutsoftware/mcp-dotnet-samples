# Model Context Protocol .NET Samples

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) .NET Samples repository! This collection of samples demonstrates how to leverage the Model Context Protocol in .NET applications.

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications - it provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

With MCP, you can:

- Utilize pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
- Flexibly switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Follow best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure
- Build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs

This repository contains .NET samples ranging from building your own MCP implementation to integrating with Azure services.

## 🔄 Understanding MCP: Servers vs Clients

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines a standardized way for AI applications to connect to external tools and data sources. This repository demonstrates both sides of the equation:

### 🔧 MCP Servers (Service Providers)
**What they do**: Expose tools, prompts, and resources that clients can discover and use  
**Think of them as**: REST APIs for AI applications  
**Examples in this repo**: The server samples below that provide specific capabilities

### 🤖 MCP Clients (Service Consumers)  
**What they do**: Connect to and consume MCP servers to leverage their capabilities  
**Think of them as**: Applications that use the REST APIs  
**Examples**: VS Code with MCP extension, custom AI applications, chatbots

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Building MCP Servers
Each server sample includes detailed instructions for setup and deployment. See individual sample directories for specific requirements.

### Building MCP Clients
If you want to build applications that **consume** MCP servers (rather than provide them), check out:
- **[How to Build MCP Clients Guide](./HOW_TO_BUILD_MCP_CLIENT.md)** - Comprehensive documentation
- **[MCP Client Sample](./mcp-client-sample/)** - Working console application example

The client sample can connect to and use any of the server samples above, demonstrating how to:
- Discover available tools from servers
- Invoke tools programmatically  
- Handle authentication and errors
- Manage multiple server connections
