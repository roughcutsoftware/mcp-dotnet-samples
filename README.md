# Model Context Protocol .NET Samples

[![Azure AI Community Discord](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/ByRwuEEgH4)](https://discord.com/invite/ByRwuEEgH4)

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) .NET Samples repository! This collection of samples demonstrates how to leverage the Model Context Protocol in .NET applications.

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications - it provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

With MCP, you can:

- Utilize pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
- Flexibly switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Follow best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure
- Build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs

This repository contains .NET samples ranging from building your own MCP implementation to integrating with Azure services.
